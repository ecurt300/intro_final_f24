                <h2>Edward James(E.J.) Curtis</h2>
                <p>Hi, my name is Edward Curtis, but I go by E.J. I am currently enrolled in the Code::You Program. I have participated in game jams using the Unity game enigne. You can find the small games 
                    I have made on my itch.io page linked below. I am currently working on a jet game. I hope to become more hireable and gain much needed experience in the Code::You program. I don't have a linkedin page setup yet. Although, I do however have 
                    a itch.io page where I have my small games ready to be downloaded which were made in game jams in Ludem Dare and a local jam at Louisville Makes Games which I go to.
